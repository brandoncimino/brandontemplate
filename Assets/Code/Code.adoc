- This code relies on *both* `UnityEditor` _and_ `UnityEngine`.
- Tested by <<_tests-editor, /Tests/Editor>>.

> aka "Play Mode."

- All of the code that runs during gameplay.
- Relies on `UnityEngine`.
- Includes *all* `MonoBehavior` descendents.
- Tested by <<_tests-runtime, /Tests/Runtime>>.

[TIP]
--
Try to use non-Unity equivalents of libraries and move your code into <<_code-standalone, /Code/Standalone>> where possible.

For example:

- `UnityEngine.Random` -> `System.Random`
- `UnityEngine.JsonUtility` -> `Newtonsoft.Json.JsonConvert`

This has several benefits, such as:

- Allowing the code to be tested using the https://www.jetbrains.com/help/rider/Running_and_Debugging_Unity_Tests.html[Standalone NUnit Launcher], which is _much_ faster than using Play Mode.
- Making the code more easily ported to non-Unity `C#` projects, like https://github.com/brandoncimino/PowerSharp[PowerSharp].
- Makes the code rely on "industry-standard" libraries, which are more likely to have strong tutorials, examples, etc.

> Code that *does not touch Unity*.

- This directory's `.asmdef` should contain:

----
  "noEngineReferences": true
----
+
- Code in this directory *cannot* reference `UnityEngine` *or* `UnityEditor`.
- Code in this directory *can* reference *Packages*, such as https://github.com/brandoncimino/brandon-utils[`brandon-utils`] or https://github.com/jilleJr/Newtonsoft.Json-for-Unity[`Newtonsoft.Json for Unity`].
- Code in this package should be tested using <<_tests-standalone, /Tests/Standalone>>.
