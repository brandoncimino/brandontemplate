.*TL;DR:* Decision-making process

====
[qanda]
Does this code import `Unity**Editor**`?::
-> link:Code/Editor/[]

Does this code import `Unity**Engine**`?::
-> link:Code/Runtime/[]

Everything else::
-> link:Code/Standalone/[]

[WARNING]
--
There are 3 different places where code is organized:

- Assembly definitions
- Folders
- Namespaces

These three levels of organization *should match each other*.

For example:

[cols="m,m,m"]
|===
|Path |Namespace |`.asmdef`

|Assets/Code/Runtime/Enemies/Slime.cs
|Code.Runtime.Enemies
|Code.Runtime.asmdef{wj}footnote:[The `.asmdef` file lives in the `Assets/Code/Runtime` folder, so the name does _not_ include `.Enemies`.]
|===
--

There are *3 kinds of code assets*:

link:Code/Runtime/["Runtime"]::
- Any code with a dependency on `UnityEngine`
- In this context, "runtime" is synonymous with "play mode"
link:Code/Editor/["Editor"]::
- Any code that *requires* a dependency on `UnityEditor`
link:Code/Editor/["Standalone"]::
- Any code that has *no Unity dependencies* - i.e. `No Engine References` is checked off



== Folders

NOTE: https://github.com/github/markup/issues/1095[Github does not support the `include::[\]` macro.] This makes me sad.
